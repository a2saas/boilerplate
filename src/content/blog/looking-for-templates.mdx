If you've ever bought a comprehensive SaaS starter kit, you know the "Day 1" ritual.

Run the install command. Marvel at the beautiful demo dashboard. Spend the next week deleting 60% of the code.

You delete the marketing pages that don't fit your brand. You delete the complex "Team Settings" widgets that don't match your data model. You fight the designer's custom CSS abstractions.

And if you're using AI agents like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude to code? You're actively hurting them.

## Context Pollution is the New Technical Debt

Modern development isn't just about _you_ reading code—it's about your AI reading it.

When you feed a "batteries-included" boilerplate into an AI context window, it has to parse hundreds of files of UI opinions just to understand your database schema. The result? Hallucinations. The agent tries to reuse a complex, custom button component you didn't even know existed. It breaks a layout because it didn't understand the custom global CSS.

A2SaaS is built differently. We built it for the agentic era.

## Opinionated Infrastructure, Unopinionated UI

We didn't leave the design blank—we just kept it standardized. A2SaaS comes pre-configured with industry standards: **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn/UI**.

We include a functional landing page and a working dashboard. They look clean and professional, but they're minimal by design. We installed the framework, not the bloat.

- **The plumbing is solid**: Auth (Clerk), Payments (Stripe), and Data (Drizzle/Neon) are wired up correctly.
- **The UI is "ready," not "finished"**: We give you the canvas and the paints, but we don't force you to use our painting.

## The "Bring Your Own UI" Philosophy

Because we use standard Tailwind and Shadcn patterns, you aren't locked into our look. You can treat the UI as an interchangeable layer.

This approach lets you grab UI blocks from the best designers in the world and drop them directly onto our foundation—without conflicts.

**Don't use our templates. Use the best in the world:**

- **Using v0.dev?** Copy-paste the code. It works instantly because our foundation is standard.
- **Love Tailwind UI?** Drop in their marketing headers. They just work.
- **Found a cool Shadcn block?** Add it. No refactoring needed.

Pick a UI kit because it fits your specific product, not because it happened to come with your database adapter.

## Generators > Templates

Because we kept the codebase clean and standard, we don't need static templates for every possible page type. instead, we rely on AI.

We ship with Claude Code skills (`/add-page`, `/add-table`) that work reliably because they don't have to navigate through 50MB of unnecessary design assets. We also include the `frontend-design` skill for generating distinctive, production-grade UI components with high design quality. Your AI simply writes standard code, and it works.
